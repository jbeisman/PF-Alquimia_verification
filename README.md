# PF-Alquimia_verification
This repo contains verification results from ParFlow-Alquimia tests

Results are located in .txt files in the individual test folders. All tests were run using the CrunchFlow geochemistry engine, except for isotherms\_1d, which contains 'crunch' and 'pflotran' folders. PF\_GetXY.py contains a python helper function to read the .txt files of these simulations. This function is hardcoded for the domain used here.
